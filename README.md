# J-Net
This is a Neural Network/Machine learning project where I explore the inner workings of data preprocessing and building neural nets from scratch with c++.

# How To Use
*  clone repository with ``git clone https://github.com/ToeJammm/J-Net``
*  use trusted data from inside the ``trainingData/`` folder in main.cpp, or import your own
*  use ``make`` to compile
*  run ``./neural_network`` executable to clean data, train, and view accuracy and training metrics
